This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project i've built designed to help players track their progress and rank in the popular video game Valorant. The Valorant leaderboard rank application that was created using Next.js, Tailwind, and Tanstack Query. When you open the application, you'll be presented with a leaderboard page that displays a list of players ranked by their Valorant score. Each player's information includes their name and their rank. By clicking on a player's name, you can view more details such as their win-loss record and match history.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
